INTRODUCTION
WHAT THIS IS
This is the source of truth for how Realty ONE Group Authentic shows up in the world. Every word we write. Every color we use. Every headline, email, social post, and presentation.
If it comes from this brand, it should look like this brand and sound like this brand. That's what this document is for.
Read it. Share it. Use it. And whenever someone asks 'how should this sound?' the answer is in here.

We are bold, direct, and unapologetically authentic. Everything in this guide exists to protect and reinforce that.

01 / BRAND FOUNDATION
WHO WE ARE
Realty ONE Group Authentic is a 100% commission real estate brokerage in Omaha, Nebraska. We exist because the traditional brokerage model is broken and agents deserve better. No splits. No nickel-and-diming. No corporate nonsense.
Just a flat fee structure, a full stack of tools and support, and a culture worth actually showing up for.
We aren't trying to be the biggest brokerage in the room. We're trying to be the most worth it.

OUR TAGLINE
100% Commission. 100% Support. ONE Incredible Culture.



CORE SLOGANS
These are not taglines for one campaign. They're the belief system. Use them in ads, emails, social, signage, conversations, and anywhere you need to cut through the noise fast.

You're Not the Problem. Your Brokerage Is.
This isn't a brokerage. It's a movement.
Stop splitting your commission. Start building your legacy.
Keep what you earn.
BECOME ONE.
Real estate is full of noise. This is the signal.

BRAND PERSONALITY
If Realty ONE Group Authentic were a person, they'd be the smartest one in the room who's also the most real. They don't talk like a press release. They tell the truth, back it up with numbers, and do it with energy.

TRAIT
WHAT IT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE
Bold & Direct
We say what everyone's thinking but nobody else says out loud. Short sentences. No hedging.
Anti-Corporate
No suits. No jargon. No 'leverage synergies.' Real humans helping real agents.
Scrappy & Hungry
We move fast. We hustle. We're proud of it and it shows.
Supportive but Edgy
We believe in you and we challenge you at the same time. Both things are true.
Aspirational but Grounded
Big vision. Practical steps. Zero fluff. We don't sell dreams, we build plans.
Proof-Driven
We back up everything with a number, a result, or a specific. Always.


THE 6 C'S
The 6 C's are the operating system of this brand. Every piece of content, every conversation, and every tool we build maps back to one of these pillars. If it doesn't serve a C, ask why it exists.

Commission.  100% commission. No splits. Flat annual fee. Agents keep what they earn. This is the foundation. Everything else is built on top of it.
Coaching.  Real training. Weekly. Scripts, role play, accountability. Not YouTube tips. Not vague encouragement. Actual skills that close deals.
Community.  Collaboration over competition. Nobody feels alone here. We win together and we mean it.
Coolture.  COOL + CULTURE. That's a word we own. Capitalize it, use it proudly, and never spell it the boring way. It's fun, authentic, and the furthest thing from corporate.
Connect.  Technology, marketing tools, and reach that makes every agent look like they have a full team behind them.
Care.  Real humans. Real help. 24/7 support, social events, education, and a community that actually shows up.

COOLTURE is not a typo. It's intentional. It's ours. Always capitalize it.


02 / VISUAL IDENTITY
COLORS
Our visual identity is dark-first with gold as the hero. Think premium streetwear brand that happens to be in real estate. High contrast. Bold. Intentional. Not corporate.
Gold is not decoration. It's direction. It tells the eye where to go and signals what matters. Use it with intention.



NAME
HEX
USAGE


Signature Gold
#C5A95E
Headlines, CTAs, icons, borders, hover states. The hero color. Everything important gets gold.


Black
#000000
Primary backgrounds, button text on gold. Authority and contrast.


White
#FFFFFF
Body text on dark sections, card backgrounds, breathing room.


Dark Gray
#1A1A1A
Card backgrounds in dark contexts, secondary dark fills.


Medium Gray
#595959
Supporting body copy in light sections. Doesn't compete.


Near-White
#F4F4F4
Soft section backgrounds. Muted content areas.


COLOR USAGE RULES
Gold (#C5A95E) is the hero.  Every CTA, every headline accent, every important border or icon gets gold. It's the first thing the eye should land on. Don't dilute it by putting gold on everything, because then nothing is important.
Black is authority.  Primary backgrounds, button text on gold, major section fills. It commands attention without competing with gold.
White is breathing room.  Body text on dark sections. Card backgrounds. The contrast that makes gold sing. Never let it get crowded.
Gray is support.  Secondary copy, labels, descriptions. It stays out of the way. It never leads.
Never use color to decorate.  Use it to communicate. Every color choice should have a reason. If you can't explain why, simplify.

TYPOGRAPHY
Typography is personality on a page. Ours says: confident, direct, and not afraid to take up space. The fonts are chosen intentionally. Each one has a job.

FONT
ROLE
HOW TO USE IT
Bebas Neue
Display — All Headlines
Always uppercase. Hero text, section titles, CTAs. Massive scale is intentional. This font IS the brand voice made visual.
Open Sans
Body — All Paragraphs
Readable, clean, friendly. Weights 300–700. The workhorse. Every line of body copy lives here.
Raleway
Accent — Quotes & Callouts
Italic treatment only. Testimonials, pullquotes, warmth moments. Use it to slow the reader down.
Montserrat
Labels & Subheadings
Uppercase with wide letter spacing. Section labels, comparison headers, small callout tags.


TYPOGRAPHY RULES
Bebas Neue is always uppercase. It's a headline font. It shouts. That's what it's there for.
Hero headlines can go massive. Enormous type is a feature, not a bug. Go big.
Body copy lives in Open Sans. Readable, clean, no drama.
Testimonials and quotes use Raleway, italic. It adds warmth. Use it to slow the reader down.
Montserrat handles labels and subheadings. Uppercase with wide letter spacing only.
Never mix more than two fonts in a single layout section. Three fonts is chaos.
Never use a font just because it looks interesting. Every font choice is a brand choice.

03 / DESIGN PRINCIPLES
HOW WE LAY THINGS OUT
Our design language is deliberate. Dark sections hit hard. Light sections let things breathe. The rhythm between them creates energy and keeps people moving through the page.
This isn't accidental. It's the visual equivalent of how we communicate: direct, then breathe, then hit again.

SECTION RHYTHM
Pages alternate between dark and light sections. Dark sections are for impact. Light sections are for depth and detail. Never stack two dark sections back to back without a reason.

SECTION TYPE
WHEN TO USE IT
Black / Dark (bg-black)
Hero moments, final CTAs, major feature sections, anything that needs to command the full room.
White / Light (bg-background)
Supporting content, tools, anything with more copy or detail that needs space to breathe.
Near-White / Muted (bg-muted)
Testimonials, comparison content, softer supporting sections between impact moments.


VISUAL PRINCIPLES
Angular dividers between sections.  No flat horizontal cuts. Diagonal clip-path transitions keep the energy moving. Straight lines are for boring brands.
Subtle texture on dark sections.  Diagonal stripe overlays at 5% opacity and ambient gold blur circles add depth without distracting.
Cards with slight rotation.  Feature cards tilt 1–2 degrees alternating. It's intentional, adds energy, and signals we're not a template.
Gold on hover.  All interactive elements get a gold border or gold fill on hover. Consistent. No exceptions.
Sharp corners on feature cards.  The 6 C's cards and brand feature cards use zero border radius. The edginess is a design decision.
Shadows are minimal.  We don't need shadows. The contrast does the work. Use shadow-2xl on forms and contact cards only.
Gold gradient dividers.  Two-pixel lines from transparent to gold to transparent separate major sections. Subtle but intentional.

BUTTONS & CTAS
Every button is a brand moment. Treat it that way.

BUTTON TYPE
HOW IT LOOKS AND WHEN TO USE IT
Primary CTA
Gold background, black text, Bebas Neue font, large. Arrow icon that shifts right on hover. The most important action on any screen.
Secondary / Outline
On dark: white border, white text. On light: gold border, gold text. Supporting action that doesn't compete.
Ghost / Text
Gold text, no border. Navigation links, 'back' actions, tertiary choices.


04 / VOICE & TONE
HOW WE SOUND
Our voice doesn't change based on the format. Whether it's a social caption, an email, a webpage, a text, or a presentation slide, it sounds like the same person wrote it.
That person is direct. Real. Energetic. Confident. And allergic to corporate nonsense.

The test: Read it out loud. Does it sound like something a real person who gives a damn would actually say? If not, rewrite it.


VOICE CHARACTERISTICS
CHARACTERISTIC
WHAT IT MEANS
Direct
Get to the point immediately. No warm-up. No preamble. Lead with the thing that matters.
Confrontational (in a good way)
Name the problem. Say what people are thinking but not saying. Create a moment of recognition.
Conversational
Write like you talk. Read everything out loud. Fragments are fine. Stiffness is not.
Confident
No hedging. No 'kind of' or 'might' or 'could potentially.' Say it like you mean it.
Proof-Driven
Every claim needs a number, a result, or a specific. 'We closed 63 deals' beats 'we close a lot.'
Encouraging
We believe in people. We show it. But we don't sugarcoat and we don't baby anyone.
Casual
'Crush it,' 'give a damn,' 'no BS' are all on-brand. Corporate stiffness is not.
Anti-Buzzword
We don't use filler words to sound impressive. We say the actual thing.


TONE BY CONTEXT
The voice stays constant. The tone adjusts slightly depending on who we're talking to and what moment we're in.

CONTEXT
TONE ADJUSTMENT
Social media
High energy. Ask a question. Make a statement. Invite a reaction. Short and punchy wins.
Email
Warmer but still direct. Lead with the point. Build with proof. One clear CTA.
Coaching or training content
Energetic. Actionable. Every piece should leave someone with something they can do today.
Agent onboarding
Welcoming, clear, excited. Make them feel like they made the right call.
Responding to complaints
Calm, direct, accountable. No corporate non-apologies. Own it and fix it.
Awards and wins
Celebrate loud. Real names, real numbers. Make the people feel seen.
Presentations and speaking
Punchy slides. Big type. Short sentences. The energy has to come through even on a screen.


WHAT WE NEVER SAY
These words and phrases are banned. They make us sound like every other corporate real estate brand and we are not that.

BANNED WORD / PHRASE
WHY IT'S BANNED
Dynamic
Overused, vague, meaningless. Everyone says this. It says nothing.
Synergy
No.
Leverage (as a verb)
Corporate speak. Say what you actually mean.
Innovative / Innovation
Show it. Don't claim it. If you have to say it, you probably don't have it.
Comprehensive
It means nothing. Be specific.
Solutions
Same problem. Be specific about what you actually do.
I hope this email finds you well.
Never. Not once. Not even close.
We're excited to announce
Just announce it. The excitement should be obvious.
Best in class
Says nothing. Prove it instead.
World class
Same.
Our passion for excellence
Cringe. Delete it.
Moving the needle
Say the actual number. What needle, by how much, for whom?


05 / WRITING GUIDELINES
THE CRAFT OF WRITING ON-BRAND
HEADLINES
Headlines are the most important thing on any page, in any email, on any slide. If the headline doesn't land, nothing else gets read.

Lead with the tension or the result. Don't warm up. Don't set context. Start with the thing that matters.
Make them feel something. Recognition, excitement, challenge, relief. Emotion beats information every time.
Use contrast. 'This isn't a brokerage. It's a movement.' Two sentences. Total reversal. Maximum impact.
Ask a question. Pull people in. 'Which one are you?' is more compelling than any statement.
Say the uncomfortable thing. The best headlines say what everyone's thinking and nobody's writing.
Two lines maximum. One is better. If you're writing a headline longer than two short lines, it's a paragraph.
Visually: always uppercase in Bebas Neue. Go big. Fill the space. Don't be timid.

Headline Examples

You're Not the Problem. Your Brokerage Is.
100% Commission. No Asterisk.
Stop Giving Away Half Your Check.
This Isn't a Brokerage. It's a Movement.
Keep What You Earn. Period.
Real estate is full of noise. We're the signal.
No Splits. No Excuses. Just Results.


BODY COPY
Body copy backs up the headline. It's where you prove the claim. Keep it specific, keep it real, and get to the point fast. No one is reading a wall of text.

WRITE THIS
NOT THIS
'63 deals last year. Real agents. Real numbers.'
'We help agents achieve their goals.'
'No fluff. No BS. Just results that show up in your bank account.'
'We are committed to providing value to our agents.'
'Real coaching. Weekly. Scripts, role play, accountability.'
'Our comprehensive training program...'
'Sick of giving away 30–50% of your check?'
'Are you looking for a more competitive commission structure?'
'Real humans. Real help. Not a portal.'
'24/7 support services are available to all agents.'
'Keep what you earn. Period.'
'Competitive commission structures are available.'
'This works. Here's the proof.'
'We believe our model delivers results.'


BODY COPY RULES
Short paragraphs. Two to three sentences max. White space is not wasted space.
Lead with the point. Never build to it. If the first sentence isn't worth reading, nothing after it will be either.
Use 'you' constantly. This is about the reader, not about us.
Be specific. 'We did 63 deals' beats 'we close a lot.' Always.
Read it out loud before it goes anywhere. If you stumble, rewrite it.
Cut the word 'that' almost every time. 'I know that this works' becomes 'I know this works.' Cleaner. Always.
Contractions are fine. 'We're' not 'we are.' 'You'll' not 'you will.' Real people talk in contractions.

CTA LANGUAGE
Every CTA should feel like an invitation. Clear, direct, and compelling. One action per section. No more.

CTA
CONTEXT
Let's Talk
Primary CTA. Use it everywhere. Approachable and direct.
BECOME ONE
Join / membership contexts. Aspirational. Big.
Book a Call
Scheduling contexts. Specific and action-oriented.
Do the Math
Calculator and proof moments. Invites engagement.
See the Difference
Comparison contexts. Curious, not pushy.
Schedule My Confidential Call
High-intent, personal outreach contexts.
Generate My [X]
Tool pages. Makes it feel personalized to the user.
Keep What You Earn
Financial proof moments. Emotionally resonant.


EMAIL-SPECIFIC RULES
Never open with 'I hope this email finds you well.' Not once. Not ever.
Subject lines should be direct and specific. Tease the value. Don't be clever for clever's sake.
First sentence does the work. If it doesn't earn the second sentence, start over.
One primary ask per email. Maybe two. Never five.
Sign off like a human. 'Talk soon. Scott.' Not 'Warm regards and best wishes.'
Short emails outperform long ones. If you need more than 200 words, ask why.

06 / QUICK REFERENCE
DO'S & DON'TS

ALWAYS DO THIS
Lead with proof. Numbers, results, and specifics over vague claims every single time.
Name the pain. If something is broken or frustrating, say it directly.
Keep it short. One sentence says it better than three. Cut until it hurts, then cut one more word.
Be human. Write like you talk. Read everything out loud before it goes anywhere.
Use gold for the things that actually matter. Not everything.
Make every headline something worth stopping for.
Let Bebas Neue do the heavy lifting on all display text.
Alternate dark and light sections. Never stack the same tone twice in a row.
Back up every claim with a number, a result, or a specific detail.
Give every page or piece one primary CTA. Not three. One.

NEVER DO THIS
Never use buzzwords. Dynamic, synergy, leverage, innovative, comprehensive, solutions. None of them.
Never be vague. If you can't say it specifically, you don't understand it well enough yet.
Never write long paragraphs on anything that gets published. Break it up.
Never open an email with 'I hope this email finds you well.'
Never put gold on everything. When everything is a highlight, nothing is.
Never mix more than two fonts in a section.
Never write a headline that requires context to land. It should hit immediately.
Never lose the edge. Polished is great. Sanitized is not. Personality is the point.
Never make the reader work to find the CTA. It should be obvious.
Never write 'we believe' or 'we are passionate about' anything. Just do the thing and show it.
